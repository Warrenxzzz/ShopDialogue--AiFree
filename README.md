# ShopDialogue--AiFree
The shop dialogue for the AI robot to follow. This bot is present on the city but this dialogue will continue although it will vary from day to day since new items are always being scavenged.

-The items in the shop are rotated every 24 hours;Two of the same items will never remain in the shop when rotated.
-The shop contains at least 1 material(iron, grass, flour, barely).
-Once every week, a legendary item will be featured on the shop. 5 minutes before rotation, the legendary item will go on sale for %33 off.
-The shop bot can be seen scavenging in various parts of the underworld. If prompted, it will offer all items for a %50 discount.
-The shop bot can be fed oil to decrease scavenging times and thus, reducing the rotation periods to 12 individual hours for 2 rotations.
-The shop bot cannot be destroyed as it is secretly a Warp agent.
-The shop bot, if attacked, will run away into small dens around the city that the player cannot get into. If a player does enter, they will be introduced to the true form of the shop bot and will be dragged into the Warp dimension.
